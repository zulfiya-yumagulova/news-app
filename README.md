App deployed here => https://newsapp-zulfiya.netlify.app

That App I built to practice React, fetching Public API,build components, React Testing Library.
To clone that repo you need open thr terminal in VSCode (or any other editor), copy the link of thr repo, and in the terminal run this command: `git clone <https://github.com/zulfiya-yumagulova/news-app>`
than ` cd News`
`npm i ` to install all dependencies, `npm start` to run your web app on localhost:3000

Happy hacking!!!
